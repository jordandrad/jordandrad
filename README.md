# Hi there! 👋 I'm Jordan

I'm a self-taught iOS developer who gets excited about creating intuitive and user-focused apps. 

## 🎯 My Passion Project

My journey in iOS development led me to create [FocusTime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focustime-time-tracker/id1663536754), an app now live on the App Store. It's designed to help users worldwide manage their time effectively and track their progress over time. While working on FocusTime, I mastered Swift, UIKit, CoreData, and RevenueCat to ensure the app is not just functional, but also delightful to use.

## 🔧 Tech Toolbox

Here's a bit about what I used in my developer toolbox:

* Swift
* SwiftUI
* UIKit
* CoreData
* RevenueCat
* RESTful APIs
* Mobile design and architectural patterns

## 🌱 Always Growing

Learning never stops! When I'm not writing code, I'm probably diving into the latest tech trends, exploring new development tools, or brainstorming on how to enhance user experience through technology.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, I'll be happy to hear from you! I'm open to collaborations and always looking forward to meeting new people who are as passionate about tech as I am.
